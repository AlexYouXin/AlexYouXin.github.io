I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Medical Robotics (IMR), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. Yun Gu and Prof. Jie Yang. Previously, I have been a visiting scholar at the Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMP), Technical University of Munich, under the supervision of Prof. Nassir Navab. I also intern at OpenMMLab in Shanghai AI Lab, working closely with Prof. Junjun He.

My research focuses on AI for Medical Imaging and AI for Healthcare , with a particular focus on CT and MRI. I work on medical image computing and cad-assisted intervention. My interests include image/video synthesis, , universal medical image segmentation, vertebral shape modeling, temporal motion modeling for pulmonary CT/Cardiac MRI.
